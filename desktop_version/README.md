# Desktop Version

This version is build for the HTC Vive. The folder "vive_unity_project" is a working unity project, but in order to make it work you need to:

1) open the project
2) download the steamVR assets
3) download the movie from github

The speed of the movie can be controlled through OSC on port 12000. Use the sensor or pd app to do so.
