# Cardboard Version

This version is build for the Google VR API and is tested with Android. The folder "gvr_unity_project" is a working unity project, but in order to make it work you need to:

1) open the project in Unity
2) import the google VR API
3) download the movie from github

The speed of the movie can be controlled with the BLE sensor or with OSC and the USB sensor.
